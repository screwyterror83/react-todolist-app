## Manage component tree.

//CHALLENGE: I have extracted the Input Area, including the <input> and
//<button> elements into a seperate Component called InputArea.

//InputArea as a separate Component.

// DO NOT: Modify the ToDoItem.jsx
// DO NOT: Move the input/button elements back into the App.jsx

Hint 1: need to think about how to manage the state of the input element in InputArea.jsx.
Hint 2: need to think about how to pass the input value back into the addItem() function in App.jsx.
